## Project Details
Navigation between pages should be done with a navbar (using JS to switch html files) AND/OR by clicking on things in the page (JS switches html files)

### Pages:

HOME page (index):  Shows list of products (can visit each product from here)

* all the products are displayed
* the images link to the PRODUCT page
* there should be a link to add a new product.


PRODUCT page: Shows specific product and it‚Äôs details

* a link back to the HOME page
* a link to edit the product (goes to the edit page)
* a delete button that deletes
* user can also search for a specific product from this page
* Clicking buy button should lower remaining by 1
* If the quantity of your item is zero, the show page should say 'OUT OF STOCK' instead of saying how many are remaining. (Hint: conditionals).
* On the edit page, make sure you can set the quantity to zero if you want so that you can test if this is working.
* The BUY button should also not be rendered if the quantity of the item is zero


EDIT page - Should allow you to edit the data of a specific product (using it‚Äôs product ID)

CREATE page - allows for creation of new products (users will include a URL for the image)

Redirects:

* The create route should redirect to HOME after creation
* The delete route should redirect to HOME after deletion
* The edit route will redirect to the edited product's PRODUCT page after the object is changed in your collection.
 
 
 
### üî¥ Mandatory To Pass:
MVP - Minimum Viable Product Your App Must Possess All These Routes

* /get_products - responds with all products in your collection
* /get_specific_product/:product_id - responds with one specific product from your collection
* /create_product - uses information from req.body to make a new product in your collection
* /delete_product/ - The product ID should be included in the URL as a query. Example: /delete_product/?productId=63cd55e8b260470b1c1f2cc0
* /update_product - uses information from req.body to update the specific product


### Technical Requirements
* Your app MUST run without syntax errors. If there are errors you can't solve, comment them out and leave a comme* nt above explaining what is wrong
* Must contain all listed Routes.
* Must be styled and look like a store.
* You MUST have a well documented README file in your repo. PLEASE add this README.md file on your own NOT through GitHub‚Ä¶
   * Good example of a README: https://github.com/chroline/well_app#readme
* In lieu of presentations, you MUST create a video (on YouTube, Vimeo, etc...) of you showcasing your application and code. This video needs to be in your README file, and
* Feel free to expand upon this project and add extra features, etc.
